# Purrimeter-Defense
A vision-based intrusion detection system for enforcing strict counter boundaries.

# Overview
I have 2 adorable *orange* kittens who love hopping on the counter and crudsnuffling around for things they probably shouldn't eat.
This project is designed as a fun way to play with recent vision models, like SAM3 or Moondream3
